This  repository contains my personal Linux setup based on catppuccin themes

</div>

## Distro
This setup is based on the [Linux Mint Cinnamon](https://linuxmint.com/download.php) distribution. You can do it on any Linux distro, but the instructions here are tailored for Linux Mint Cinnamon.

## Distro Theme
To install all of these themes you might need root access.

2. Extract the downloaded archive.
3. Move the extracted folder to `/usr/share/themes/`
